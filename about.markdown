My name is Elias Carter. I am a professional software engineer with an interest in Linux systems programming and OS primitives (namespaces, cgroups, threads, shared memory, networking); data intensive applications; network security and security tenable to users; and aiding the human aspect of development through ergonomic tools, standards, culture, and blameless root cause analysis.

I created this blog to improve my writing skills as well as share with the technical community some hard learned lessons discovered through my work as well as recreational activity.

### The website
This website was created using a static website builder -- jekyll -- with the source code published here: [https://github.com/edcarter/eliascarter.ca](https://github.com/edcarter/eliascarter.ca). I publish the website to a S3 bucket which is cached by cloudfront and served straight to you anywhere in the world, for only about $0.50 per month.

### My Experience
If you are interested in my professional experience you can view my resume on the website [here](/assets/resume.pdf). Generally, I am always open to new work opportunities, but I am currently happy with my current workplace. If you are interested in working together with me feel free to send me an email and I will usually get back to you promptly.

### Licensing
Everything contained within the [git repo](https://github.com/edcarter/eliascarter.ca) for this website is within the public domain. Do whatever you want with it, open source licensing causes way too much friction and is usally an ambiguous unenforcable mess which gets in the way of solving real problems. I appreciate credit for any work, but I'm not going to pretend that putting a GPL on my website will get people to give me credit in the first place, so I will take whatever I can get.
